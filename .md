versioning:
previous feature updated: increase major version
new features are added which are backward campatible: increase minor version
few bugfixes, little bit refactoring which is backward compatible : increase patch version

versions in package:

1. with carets(^):"^4.19.2" : //auto update to "4.x.x". that means your current version will get autoupdate when there is higher versions in minor or patches. not when major version.

2. with tilda (~):"~4.19.2" : // means you can use any version 1.2.x, where x is the patch number (e.g., 1.2.4, 1.2.5, etc.), but not a new minor or major version (like 1.3.0).

express:

- routing paths + request method = endpoint
- route paths can be strings, string patterns or regular expressions.

Routes:

- you must send some response in route handler function else it will go in infinite loop and eventually request will be timed out after some time.
- There can be multiple route handlers for one route.
- res.send() is just like `return` statement in c++ or c.program stops execution after return statement.
- use try-catch blocks for error handling
- use middleware to handle unexpected error. always put that error handler at the end of all routes as wildcard route else it will create issue in you routes execution because order of routes matter in express.

nodejs is just a cpp application, with v8 engine embedded in it.
ECMASCRIPT: standard for scripting languages
v8 engine: c++ application which understands the given JS code and converts into the machine level code to execute the task

## Js

## C++

Machine code --------
--- | low level code
assembly code--------

---

binary code

commonjs module: by default in nodejs (cjs)
module.exports
require()
synchronous way of importing the module
code runs in non-strict mode

ES modules (ESM): mjs
import, export
asynchronous way of importing the module
code runs in strict mode

when we call require() function, it take all the code inside that file/module and wraps inside on function that's why you cannot access its internal functions and variables outside of it. you will have to export them to use.
Its a IIFE ( immediately invoked function expression )
(function (){})()
keep's variables and functions private

you are getting a syntax error in nodejs because v8 engine is not able to generate abstract syntax tree from your code. that is after process of tokanization, when v8 is doing syntax analysis, he got some unexpected token and throws syntax error.

JIT Compilation ( Just In Time )

lexical analysis (tokenization)
syntax analysis ( AST )
AST -> ignition interpreter -> byte code -> execution
|\_\_\_ Turbofan compiler-> optimized machine code -> execution
the code which is required number of times, ignition interpreter give it to turbofan compilter to use whenever needed.

consider waiting of event loop at poll phase in idle state, so whenever the new poll callback comes event loop starts from polling phase only.
nexttick queue has higher priority

tick: one cycle of event loop

thread pool : 4 threads by default
used for fs, dns lookup, crypto, user specified input

synchronous code: single threaded
asynchronous code: multithreaded ( uv_threadpool)

thead pool size can be changed using on variable as below in your file:
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=2;

scalable I/O event notification mechanism

timers queue : min-heap
epoll: red black tree

websockets: more persistent socket

mongodb:
db>collection>document>fields

what is package means? : basically it is a code, which has certain methods written inside it to fulfill a certain purpose or to do certain tasks.
e.g mongodb package
-> mongodb package has methods written inside it to handle ( read, write ) db from code. so when we want to read or write something to our database we use that methods provided in
mongodb package to do that. we don't write that code by ourself.
