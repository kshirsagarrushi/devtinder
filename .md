versioning:
previous feature updated: increase major version
new features are added which are backward campatible: increase minor version
few bugfixes, little bit refactoring which is backward compatible : increase patch version

versions in package: 

1. with carets(^):"^4.19.2" : //auto update to "4.x.x". that means your current version will get autoupdate when there is higher versions in minor or patches. not when major version.

2. with tilda (~):"~4.19.2" : // means you can use any version 1.2.x, where x is the patch number (e.g., 1.2.4, 1.2.5, etc.), but not a new minor or major version (like 1.3.0).
